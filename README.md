ADCAU, versió 2.0
=================

What is it
----------

Still WORK IN PROGRESS.. This is a brief and incomplete description of my project ADCAU (ADministracio per a un Centre d'Atenció a l'Usuari)

This is my second version of an application for the management of computers, electronic stuff and installed application - licenses - in a business.

You can register issues that happen and link them to a location, a user, and you can put some tags on the description of the issue. The issues can be have three states: draft, opened or closed.

It allows the administrator to have a register of computers and installed applications in an office or business. You can also the rest of machines, such as like printers, routers, switches or scanners.

The current version is in Catalan, but is expected to work as well in English and Spanish in the future.
